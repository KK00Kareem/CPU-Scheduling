üöÄ Brief Overview of CPU Scheduling Algorithms Code

This Python script implements various CPU scheduling algorithms, offering a comprehensive exploration of First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF) in both preemptive and non-preemptive modes, Priority Scheduling, Round Robin (RR), and Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ). The code incorporates user-friendly prompts for process details, facilitates dynamic visualization using Matplotlib, and allows users to understand the nuances of each scheduling strategy.

üîç Key Components:

1. Class Structure: Organized into classes such as Process, Process_S, Process_prio, and Process_rr to represent different scheduling scenarios.
2. Algorithm Implementation: Each scheduling algorithm is implemented as a function (fcfs_scheduling, sjf_scheduling, priority_scheduling, rr_scheduling, mlfq.schedule).
3. Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib to create Gantt charts, providing a visual representation of the process execution timeline for better comprehension.
4. User Input Handling: Prompts users for input related to process details, number of processes, time quantum, and other parameters.

üë®‚Äçüíª How to Use:

1. Menu Selection: Choose a scheduling algorithm from the provided menu (1-6).
2. Input Details: Follow prompts to input the number of processes and relevant details for each algorithm.
3. Visualize and Analyze: Observe the Gantt charts and statistical information generated for each scheduling algorithm.
4. Educational Exploration: The code serves as an educational tool for understanding the working principles of diverse CPU scheduling strategies.

üìà Customization and Extension:

Users can modify the code to suit specific scenarios or integrate it into larger projects.
Experiment with different inputs to observe the impact on scheduling outcomes.
Feel free to explore and utilize this code as a hands-on learning resource or as a foundation for further development. It provides a practical insight into the world of CPU scheduling algorithms, making complex concepts accessible and visually interpretable.
